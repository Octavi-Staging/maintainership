# Maintainers conduct notes:

The maintainers:

1 - Mustn't insult, use hate words, do personal attacks or any action that is unacceptable towards the creation of a positive environment with the team. 

2 - Mustn't do any unofficial modifications over official sources.

3 - Must upload:

3.1 - Their tree stuff on [Devices Hub](https://github.com/OctaviOS-Devices) organization. The trees should fully reflect the changes when a new build is pushed for that specific device tree(s). Last but not the least, it should be fully buildable.

3.2 - Changelogs for each build.

4 - Must test every build properly before releasing for public.

5 - Must keep proper authorship of git commits that are pushed for all repository failing to which action will be taken towards him. Force-pushes are exception and should be mentioned.

6 - If there's any relationship, personal fights, those can be done in DM on Telegram.

7. You can ship device specific parts like XiaomiParts,RealmeParts,Dolby etc but it should be proper functional.

8 - Mustn't add:

8.1 - Custom build fingerprints except for safetynet bypass.

8.2 - Playground or anything else related to get Pixel-like features that aren't available from the ROM sources (only GoogleCamera is acceptable).

If any of those rules were broken, there will be an immediate action towards the maintainer.
