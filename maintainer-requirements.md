# To become an official maintainer for Octavi-OS :

Before you apply for official maintainership, you should know a few things:

1. You **MUST** own the device. Blind and untested builds aren't allowed. Unified, devices with minimal hardware changes are also allowed to be maintained.

2. You must have basic git (cherry-pick, squash, merge, etc.) knowledge.

3. You must have a daily usable unofficial build released almost a week earlier before applying.

4. **ALL** of your trees **MUST** be open-source everytime private stuff not allowed it should be added to our DevicesHub [here](https://github.com/OctaviOS-Devices) post official maintainership.

5. Your build **MUST** be SELinux enforcing (Exceptions can be made for legacy devices or for other reasons).

6. Prebuilt kernels only allowed **if your device does not have proper kernel sources**. You **MUSTN'T** ship a prebuilt kernel if you have working kernel sources available just because you save 5 minutes of build time.

7. Authorship and commit history **MUST** be proper.

8. You **MUST** meet all requirements as mentioned [here](requirements.md).

If all is well, you may apply [here](https://github.com/Octavi-Staging/maintainership/issues/new/choose)
